# Unofficial Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning
This page is created for the overflow attendees Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning. 

As you may know, OpenAI is putting together a [Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning](https://github.com/openai/socml16/wiki). The number of attendees is limited to about 200 people in order to make event work best. Many people from the community showed the interest in an event for those who will not be able to attend, so [Joseph Catrambone](https://github.com/JosephCatrambone) reached us out with this idea asking to help with that.

We are happy to help and would like to thank the community and Joseph giving us this courtesy. Also, [Jack Crawford](https://github.com/jackccrawford) kindly offered to host afterparty after the official event on Friday, October 7th, at around 6-7 pm. Address and details are below.

##Format
It would be fair to say that this event, as a spin-off of the original conference, is dedicated to OpenAI. It is also fair to say that we, as a community, having diverse backgrounds, expertise and skills can provide meaningful input for them, by tackling or trying to tackle problems they are working on. In that regard, we propose an experimental format, that will allow us to make an impact and showcase our capabilities on both personal and group levels.

On Saturday, October 1st, we will host a 12-hours event focusing on [Special Projects](https://openai.com/blog/special-projects/) of OpenAI.
- **The idea** is to compose 4 teams accordingly to 4 projects, that will brainstorm,run experiments,hack or simply put together a report with their findings or conclusions. 
- **The Goal** is to provide a new perspective on issues, try to find the solutions or propose new approach.
- **The Outcome** of the work of every group will be:
  * Code/Repo of proposed solution or results of the experiments that the group has been running
  * Report with summary of a session with discoveries, conclusions or assumptions a group have made towards an issue
  * Combination of the previous 2 or a 3rd format that will showcase the results of a group

All results will be submitted to OpenAI alongside with the names of the participants and a group lead.

##Prerequisites
In order to pull this off, two elements are required:
- **Facilitator**, a person who leads the working group and is responsible for the outcome of the team. A facilitator posess necessary skills and expertise in the topic that allows her to guide and navigate through an agenda. Being a facilitator means:
  * Understanding the goals of the meeting and the organization
  * 
Keeping the group on the agenda and moving forward
Involving everyone in the meeting, including drawing out the quiet participants and controlling the domineering ones
Making sure that decisions are made democratically
  * Makes sure everyone feels comfortable participating
  * Develops a structure that allows for everyone's ideas to be heard
Making members feel good about their contribution to the meeting
Making sure the group feels that the ideas and decisions are theirs, not just the leader's. Supporting everyone's ideas and not criticizing anyone for what they've said.
