# Unofficial Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning

**When: Saturday, October 1, 2016.**  **9:00am- 9:00pm**

**Where: 404 Bryant Street, Sandbox Suites**

This page is created for the overflow attendees Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning. 

As you may know, OpenAI is putting together the [Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning](https://github.com/openai/socml16/wiki). The number of attendees is limited to about 200 people in order to make event work best. Members of the community proposed unofficial event for the overflow attendees, so [Joseph Catrambone](https://github.com/JosephCatrambone) reached us out with this idea asking to help with that.

We are happy to help and would like to thank the community and Joseph for giving us this courtesy. There are 3 parts of unofficial event with the following agenda:

##Agenda
- **Afterparty of official SOCML16** [Jack Crawford](https://github.com/jackccrawford) kindly offered to host afterparty of the official event to be held on Friday, October 7th, at around 6-7 pm. [Address](https://goo.gl/maps/XMyHxQYhBhC2)
- **Unofficial SOCML16** is an experimental format of a 12-hours working session consisted of 4 teams tackling [Special Projects](https://openai.com/blog/special-projects/) for OpenAI. Each group is limited to 10 members max. Read the details about the format below.
- **Meetup** for the overflow attendees. This will be a regular gathering for the community, that will be hosted in the evening of unsocml16.

      -**Schedule:**
      - 9:00am  - registration
      - 10:00am - welcome note, group formation
      - 10:15am - 9:00pm - working session
      - 7:00pm  - meetup starts
      - 9:00pm  - closing notes
      
Groups will be provided with the separate office spaces, in case meetup will be loud. 

##Unofficial SOCML16 Format
It would be fair to say that this event, as a spin-off of the original conference, is dedicated to OpenAI. It is also fair to say that we, as a community, having diverse backgrounds, expertise and skills can provide meaningful input for them, by tackling or trying to tackle problems they are working on. In that regard, we propose an experimental format, that will allow us to make an impact and showcase our capabilities on both personal and group levels.

On Saturday, October 1st, we will host a 12-hours event focusing on [Special Projects](https://openai.com/blog/special-projects/) of OpenAI.
- **The idea** is to compose 4 teams accordingly to 4 projects, that will brainstorm,run experiments,hack or simply put together a report with their findings or conclusions. 
- **The Goal** is to provide a new perspective on issues, try to find the solutions or propose a new approach.
- **The Outcome** of the work of every group will be:
  * Code/Repo of proposed solution or results of the experiments that the group has been running
  * Report with summary of a session with discoveries, conclusions or assumptions a group has made towards an issue
  * Combination of the previous 2 or a 3rd format that will showcase the results of a group

All results will be submitted to OpenAI alongside with the names of the participants and a group lead.

##Prerequisites
In order to pull this off, two elements are required:
- **Group Lead/Facilitator**, is a person who leads the working group and is responsible for the outcome of the team. A group lead possesses necessary skills and expertise in the topic that allows her to guide and navigate through an agenda. Being a facilitator means:
  * Understanding the goals of the working group
  * Keeping the group on the agenda and moving forward
  * Involving everyone in the meeting, including drawing out the quiet participants and controlling the domineering ones
  * Makes sure everyone feels comfortable participating
  * Develops a structure that allows for everyone's ideas to be heard
  * Assign a support person together with whom will capture the working group findings to a written report
for immediate delivery.

- **Group Members** are people who compose a team around the topic of interest. Group members are masterminds behind the solutions and findings of the given topics. 

###Backgrounds 
This event will assume some familiarity with machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Attendees who are not familiar with the concepts below are encouraged to brush up using the references provided below.
- Basics:
  * Linear Algebra
  * Calculus 
  * Probability and Programming 
- * For introductory material on machine learning, see
      - [Andrew Ng's course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
      - [Geoffrey Hinton's course on neural nets](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets)
- For introductory material on deep Learning and reinforcement learning, see:
  * Stanford’s [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is a great starting point, covering Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
  * Books on Deep Learning:
      - [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow
      - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen 
      - Computer Vision is covered by most, if not all, of the deep learning resources 
      - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the basis of neural network based models that solve tasks related to sequences such as machine translation or speech recognition. Must read: Karpathy’s [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)  and Chris Olah’s [post on LSTMs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
      - Natural Language Processing (NLP): [CS224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) is an introduction to NLP with deep learning. 
      - Reinforcement Learning: [videos of David Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) on RL Andrej Karpathy’s [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) on deep reinforcement learning 
- Python is a primary choice for DL

##Participation
For participation in Unofficial SOCML16 fill in the registration form below:
[UNSOCML16 Registration](https://goo.gl/forms/n3GFzLdOAISs13Rv2)
Please choose how do you want to participate (Group Lead/Group Member) and the topic you are interested in.
####Choosing a Group Lead
A group lead is required to have the relevant background, expertise, and skills and is responsible for a group outcome. We use our network and reaching out people who can be a good fit for that, but we would like to encourage members of the community to apply as well as propose someone who might be a good fit (send your proposals to e@xix.ai)

All 4 group leads will be announced prior the event in the Slack channel

####Communication
- Join [AI Meetup Series Slack](https://xixslack.herokuapp.com/) and use [#unsocml16 channel](https://aimeetupseries.slack.com/messages/unsocml16/) for the event
- Questions or proposals send to e@xix.ai
